Midterm 7 Instructions
===========================

Do the following three parts and upload the asked for files to
the assignment folder for Midterm 7 by the due time
indicated on the assignment folder. You will have 2 hours and
50 minutes to do the exam. 

You will need to attend the zoom session and at least type 
‘here’ at the chat box.  Please don't use audio as noise might
be disturbing to other students. Please monitor the chat box
for any updates.

You can ask questions (at the chat box please) and I can either
answer them or not answer them.  I can clarify what you need to
do but I cannot give you any help during the exam.

Since I can’t monitor what you will be seeing on your computer,
you can use notes and the textbook.  However, do not copy and 
paste large amounts of code from the internet.  I will be copying
your code into the Google prompt and if your copying large 
amounts of code it will show up in my search results. If this 
happens then you will get an automatic zero and will be ask  
to take a makeup exam.

You will need to do your coding at the Linux command line. 
You can optionally use your own Linux command line or MacOS
command line as long as it has a valid bash shell environment.  

For Part II and III, I will provide you with source code to 
work with. It will include a main function with some example
arrays of numbers for you to test your code.  However, when
I'm grading your submission, I will be using a different set 
of numbers. So don’t write your code to only work with the 
given data.

Also, I will be copying your functions over to a different
main file with the same main function but different data.
So if you are re-writing the main function for debugging 
purposes, make sure your code will work with the ORIGINAL 
main function before you hand it in.

====================================
Part I Design a Class Definition
====================================

You are asked to design a class definition to be put in 
a header file called fazzfizz.h  A jewelry store sells 
FazzFizz which are a set of artsy necklaces. For each
FazzFizz, the store wants to keep track of the following
attributes:
 
        * metal: This is the metal used in the jewelry
                   Examples: "gold","silver","bronze"
        * length: This is the length in inches. This is always
                     a whole number of inches.
        * price:  the price of this type of jewelry.

Each attribute will have a corresponding getter(accessor)
function or setter(mutator) function. PLEASE PUT ONLY FUNCTION
PROTOTYPES IN YOUR CLASS; DO NOT ADD ANY FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION
CODE. These would normally be put into a .cpp file which you do
not need to provide. 

Also remember to add a default constructor as well as a constructor
that takes the attributes.

Submit your header file with the class definition to the d2l midterm
assignment folder by the due time.

==================================
Part II Implement a Find Function
==================================

Download the midterm7.cpp file from the d2l folder. 
You will implement a function that will involve 
finding the last instance of a multiple of 5 in an array
of integers and returning the index of this item.

The array will be of integers that are positive numbers.
Also, if there is no multiples of 5, the function should
return a zero.

EXAMPLES
==========
Array = 41, 45, 300, 50, 4, 91
index is: 3
Array =  5437, 4233, 23333, 55788
index is: 0

===================================== 
Part III Implement Delete Function
=====================================

Find the last instance of a multiple of 5 in the given
array and delete this from the array. If there are no
multiples of 5, then delete the first element in the
array.

You can use the part II find function to get an index.

Don't change the order of the other elements in the array.

Upload the midterm7.cpp file to the d2l assignment
folder before the due time.

EXAMPLES
==========
BEFORE
Array = 41, 45, 300, 50, 4, 91
AFTER
Array = 41, 45, 300, 4, 91
BEFORE
Array =  5437, 4233, 23333, 55788
AFTER
Array =  4233, 23333, 55788
